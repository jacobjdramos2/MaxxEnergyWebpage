### IMPORTANT ###
<details>
<summary>üö´ <strong>Do Not Push Directly to <code>main</code></strong></summary>

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The `main` branch is reserved for stable, production-ready code. To prevent conflicts and accidental overwrites, follow this rule:

- **DO NOT** push directly to the `main` branch
- Always create a working branch from `dev` or `main` using:
  ```bash
  git checkout dev        # or main
  git pull origin dev     # or main
  git checkout -b feature-yourname
  
Push your changes to your branch:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin feature-yourname
Submit a Pull Request into the dev branch for review

Only the team lead will merge into main after testing and approval

‚úÖ Thank you for helping keep our project organized, collaborative, and bug-free!
